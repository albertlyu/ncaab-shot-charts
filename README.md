ncaab-shot-charts
=================

A JavaScript project for visualizing NCAA men's basketball play-by-play shot location data. This is currently a sandbox for me to experiment with different JavaScript libraries for visualizing shot location data. The goal is to eventually convert this repository into an open source project for a web application of NCAA men's basketball shot charts.
