Shot Charts 3.0
=================

A Rails web application for visualizing NCAA men's basketball play-by-play shot location data from the 2013-14 season.

This started out as a sandbox for me to experiment with different JavaScript libraries for visualizing shot location data. The goal was to eventually convert this repository into an open source project for a web application of NCAA men's basketball shot charts.

The application is currently in an early development phase in order to create a minimum viable product (see our MVP milestone in our list of issues). More updates to come.
