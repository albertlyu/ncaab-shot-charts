ncaab-shot-charts
=================

A Rails web application for visualizing NCAA men's basketball play-by-play shot location data from the 2013-14 season. 

This started out as a sandbox for me to experiment with different JavaScript libraries for visualizing shot location data. The goal is to eventually convert this repository into an open source project for a web application of NCAA men's basketball shot charts.
